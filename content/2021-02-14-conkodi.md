During add-on development I use Kodi installed on my operating system for testing. But what if I
need to test my changes on various Kodi versions? It's not so easy to install different versions
of a package on such distros as Ubuntu. We could try some Kodi container image but I decided to
build my own.

## Existing Kodi container images

Before I started working on my Kodi container image I checked what other people did in this area.

### [docker.io/linuxserver/kodi-headless](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-kodi-headless)

This image has patched Kodi in order to run it without graphical user interface. The README has
this description "most useful for a mysql setup of kodi to allow library updates to be sent without
the need for a player system to be permanently on". Despite on its advantages this image doesn't
fully fits to my needs. If you develop an add-on with UI you would also like see how the elements
are displayed in Kodi.

### [docker.io/erichough/kodi](https://github.com/ehough/docker-kodi)

This one has completely different purpose. The goal is to provide containerized Kodi with full
support of audio and video. It requires `x11docker` to be installed on the host in order to forward
streams from the container to the host. `docker.io/erichough/kodi` doesn't fit my needs as well. I
don't need support of audio and video playback and I don't want to install any dependencies other
than docker or podman.

I think these two images are the most popular in the Docker Hub and they either don't missing GUI
or have redundant dependencies. That's why I decided to create my own Kodi container image.

## Conkodi

I need a minimalistic container image with Kodi that is able to display GUI without audio and
video playback capabilities. After several attempts I came to this dockerfile:

```dockerfile
# Team Kodi officially supports ppa for Ubuntu
FROM ubuntu:20.04

# Packages installation should be unattended
ARG DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive
# YOu can specify a version of Kodi to install as build arg
ARG KODI_VERSION=18.9

# This needed for running VNC
ENV DISPLAY=:99 

# Adding ppa and install dependencies
RUN apt update && \
    apt install -y --no-install-recommends software-properties-common && \
    add-apt-repository -y ppa:team-xbmc/ppa && \
    apt -y purge openssl software-properties-common && \
    apt install -y --no-install-recommends dumb-init \
                                           # Without pulseaudio Kodi logs are unreadble and useless
                                           pulseaudio \
                                           # This needs for establishing SSL connections 
                                           ca-certificates \
                                           # Tigervnc implements an X server and provides VNC access
                                           tigervnc-standalone-server \
                                           tigervnc-xorg-extension \
                                           kodi=2:${KODI_VERSION}+* && \
    apt -y --purge autoremove

COPY start.sh /
COPY guisettings.xml /home/kodi/.kodi/userdata/guisettings.xml

# Various permission tweaks
RUN chmod +x /start.sh && \
    touch /home/kodi/.Xauthority && \
    chgrp -R 0 /home/kodi/ && \
    chmod -R g=u /home/kodi/

WORKDIR /home/kodi

# VNC port
EXPOSE 5999
# HTTP port
EXPOSE 8080
# EventServer port
EXPOSE 9777/udp

# It always a good practice to run applications in the container under some user
USER 1001
ENTRYPOINT ["/usr/bin/dumb-init", "--"]
CMD ["/start.sh"]
```

And here the starting script:

```bash
#!/bin/sh

pulseaudio > /dev/null 2>&1 &

vncserver $DISPLAY -noxstartup \
                   -securitytypes none \
                   -geometry 1600x900 \
                   # kodi doesn't start on lower depth values
                   -depth 24 \
                   -alwaysshared > /dev/null 2>&1 &

/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/kodi/kodi.bin --standalone  > /dev/null 2>&1 &

# Kodi starts with some delay
while [ ! -f ".kodi/temp/kodi.log" ]; do
    sleep 0.1
done

# Show kodi.log to the container's stdout
tail -f .kodi/temp/kodi.log
```

## Troubles

### Bit depth

Let me share the troubles I faced during development of Conkodi. In the beginning Kodi wasn't able
to start. It crashed immediately with the error message `Failed to find matching visual`. Here I
should say that I started the vnc server in this way:

```shell
vncserver $DISPLAY -noxstartup \
                   -securitytypes none \
                   -geometry 1600x900 \
                   -depth 16 \
                   -alwaysshared > /dev/null 2>&1 &
```

I usually use `-depth 16` in order to reduce resources consumption but apparently Kodi just doesn't
start if the bit depth lower 24. I had to look into Kodi sources to find root cause of the crash.
I searched the string `Failed to find matching visual` and found one mention [here](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/blob/5230b683323ca58c62459a371c1306a6cb4d4644/xbmc/windowing/X11/WinSystemX11.cpp#L720). I found
`GetVisual()` method in `xbmc/windowing/X11/WinSystemX11GLContext.cpp`:

```c++
XVisualInfo* CWinSystemX11GLContext::GetVisual()
{
  int count = 0;
  XVisualInfo vTemplate;
  XVisualInfo *visual = nullptr;

  int vMask = VisualScreenMask | VisualDepthMask | VisualClassMask;

  vTemplate.screen = m_screen;
  vTemplate.depth = 24;
  vTemplate.c_class = TrueColor;

  visual = XGetVisualInfo(m_dpy, vMask, &vTemplate, &count);

  if (!visual)
  {
    vTemplate.depth = 30;
    visual = XGetVisualInfo(m_dpy, vMask, &vTemplate, &count);
  }

  return visual;
}
```

Aha, perhaps `vTemplate.depth = 24;` means that Kodi expects that the bit depth equals 24. I changed
the argument for `vncserver` and Kodi started.

### Kodi logs

Another problem was Kodi logs. After starting the only thing I could see in the logs was:

```text
ERROR: CActiveAESink::OpenSink - no sink was returned
```

I wanted to have as minimal image as possible and I didn't include `pulseaudio` that caused this
error. Having readable Kodi logs was one of my requirements therefore I added pulseaudio as well.

### Volume mounts permissions

Last problem was to set the correct permission for mounted volumes. I found that the container runs
with `umask` `0022` it means new files are created with mode `644` and directories are created with
`755`.  This permissions don't allow to delete files under host user in mounted directories. I
needed to increase the privileges with `sudo`. Fortunately, `podman` has a cool feature to run
containers with a certain umask value:

```bash
podman run -it --umask=0002 --volume=/some/dir:/mnt quay.io/quarck/conkodi:18
```

## Building

If you want build the image locally just clone the repo and use your favorite container engine tool.
I prefer `podman` and `buildah`:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/quarckster/conkodi.git
buildah bud --build-arg=<version of Kodi> -t conkodi:<version of Kodi> -f conkodi/stable.Dockerfile conkodi
```

You can also build an image with nightly version of Kodi:

```bash
buildah bud -t conkodi -f conkodi/nightly.Dockerfile conkodi
```

### Prebuilt images

I have prebuilt some images and pushed them quay.io registry. You can find list of tags in
<https://quay.io/repository/quarck/conkodi?tab=tags>

## Usage

Just use the following command:

```bash
podman run -it --name kodi --rm -p 5999:5999 -p 8080:8080 -p 9777:9777/udp quay.io/quarck/conkodi:18
```

You can access Kodi GUI using any VNC client, e.g.:

```bash
krdc vnc://127.0.0.1:5999
```
