I'm an automation engineer with more than 7 years of experience. My main focus is testing web
applications both on-premise and cloud. I use Python to create automated test suites. I have
experience in maintaining the full release cycle of software: from source code to production.
It includes creating tests, setting up a pipeline in CI/CD, building container images, and pushing
them to the production environment. I'm passionate about best practices and community standards.
I'm always ready to help and think that collaboration is the key to success.
The purpose of this blog is to keep somewhere my technical notes, observations and share experience.
